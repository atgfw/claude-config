❯ What's the goal? Testing session start

● Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● Session start confirmed working. The active goal is loaded.

  Current Goal: Unify goal injection across all Claude Code message types and external systems

  This involves ensuring consistent goal context injection across:
  - Claude Code sessions (UserPromptSubmit, PostToolUse, Stop, SessionStart hooks)
  - GitHub issues (body checklists, parent/child relationships)
  - OpenSpec proposals
  - Claude Code .md plans
  - Session todo headers

  The mechanism is a shared formatGoalContext() function injected via additionalContext in all hook event types.

  ---ACTIVE GOAL: Unify goal injection across all Claude Code message types and external systems
  - WHO: Claude Code sessions, GitHub issues, OpenSpec proposals, Claude Code .md plans, and their respective subtask checklists
  (session todos, issue body checklists, issue parent/child relationships, OpenSpec todos, plan todos)
  - WHAT: Inject identical structured goal context into every message, artifact, and checklist item
  - WHEN: every turn, every hook, every create/update/delete of any artifact; prompt user with soft suggestion to define/hydrate
  goal when missing or inconsistent across artifacts
  - WHERE: UserPromptSubmit, PostToolUse, Stop, SessionStart hooks; session todo headers; GitHub issue bodies; OpenSpec proposal
  bodies; Claude Code .md plan bodies
  - WHY: maintain focus and traceability across all systems uniformly; ensure no work proceeds without explicit goal alignment
  - HOW: shared formatGoalContext() injected via additionalContext in all hook event types
