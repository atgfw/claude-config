Client Credentials Management
To access ServiceTitan APIs, your app must supply a client ID and client secret. Who will configure these credentials within the app?

I, the app developer, will configure the credentials on behalf of each tenant
Select this option if you will securely store the credentials in a file, database, or key vault. After a tenant connects your app, you can view the client ID and generate the client secret by going to “My Apps” and clicking “View Connections”.

Tenants will configure the credentials themselves
Select this option if tenants will input the credentials through your app’s configuration screen. Tenants can obtain these credentials by signing in to ServiceTitan and going to Settings > Integrations > API Application Access.
⚠
Security Note
You must keep client IDs and client secrets confidential. Never publish them with your source code, embed them within web pages, or distribute them via an app store.
