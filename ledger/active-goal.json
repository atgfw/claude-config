  "goal": "Generalize LLM extraction to handle human-to-human, outbound, and internal calls without hardcoded AI-to-human assumptions",
  "fields": {
    "who": "LLM Data Extraction Pipeline consumers (Rewst, ServiceTitan workflows, direct API callers)",
    "what": "Add conversation context model to support AI-to-human, human-to-human, inbound, outbound, and internal conversation types",
    "when": "Before next production deployment of extraction pipeline",
    "where": "LLM Data Extraction Pipeline (workflow 8ZN0l9BHo1zBKDnl) and category configs",
    "why": "Current implementation assumes AI-to-human inbound calls only, breaking extraction accuracy for other conversation types",
    "how": "Add optional conversation_context input field, modify category prompts to use context-aware role mapping, maintain backward compatibility",
    "which": "9 category configs (caller, contact, routing, request, consent, call_validity, sales, sentiment, coaching) + input validator",
    "lest": "Incorrect role attribution (who is 'caller' vs 'agent'), wrong sentiment analysis, broken coaching metrics for human agents",
    "with": "OpenAI Structured Outputs API, n8n-MCP, existing category architecture",
    "measuredBy": "95%+ role attribution accuracy across 6 conversation types, zero regression on existing AI-to-human inbound extractions"
