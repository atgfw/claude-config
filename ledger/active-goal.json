  "goal": "Generalize LLM extraction for all conversation types: phone, chat, video, in-person, and all directions",
  "fields": {
    "who": "LLM Data Extraction Pipeline consumers (Rewst, ServiceTitan workflows, direct API callers)",
    "what": "Add conversation context model supporting 6 modalities (phone, chat, video, in-person, voicemail, email) and 4 directions (inbound, outbound, internal, multi-party)",
    "when": "Before next production deployment of extraction pipeline",
    "where": "LLM Data Extraction Pipeline (workflow 8ZN0l9BHo1zBKDnl) and category configs",
    "why": "Current implementation assumes AI-to-human inbound phone calls only, breaking extraction accuracy for chats, meetings, outbound calls, and other modalities",
    "how": "Add optional conversation_context with modality/direction/participants fields, modify category prompts to use context-aware role mapping, maintain backward compatibility",
    "which": "9 category configs (caller, contact, routing, request, consent, call_validity, sales, sentiment, coaching) + input validator",
    "lest": "Incorrect role attribution, wrong sentiment analysis, broken coaching metrics, inappropriate terminology for non-phone modalities",
    "with": "OpenAI Structured Outputs API, n8n-MCP, existing category architecture",
    "measuredBy": "95%+ accuracy across 6 modalities and 4 directions, zero regression on existing AI-to-human inbound phone extractions"
