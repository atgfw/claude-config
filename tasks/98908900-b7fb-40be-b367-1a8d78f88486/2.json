  "subject": "Fix duration format spec-code discrepancy",
  "description": "Aligned spec with existing code behavior. Removed the sub-60s special case from the Duration formatting scenario. Code always uses `{m}m {s}s` format (e.g., \"0m 45s\"), which is consistent and tested across 160 tests. Evidence: `specs/call-record-integration/spec.md:58` - `- **THEN** the system SHALL format as \\`{m}m {s}s\\` (e.g., \"1m 14s\", \"0m 45s\")`",
