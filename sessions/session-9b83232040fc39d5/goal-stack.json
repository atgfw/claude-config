      "summary": "Implement unified goal injection across all Claude Code message types and external systems",

        "who": "Claude Code sessions, GitHub issues, OpenSpec proposals, Claude Code .md plans, and their respective subtask checklists (session todos, issue body checklists, issue parent/child relationships, OpenSpec todos, plan todos)",
        "what": "Inject identical structured goal context into every message, artifact, and checklist item",
        "when": "every turn, every hook, every create/update/delete of any artifact; prompt user with soft suggestion to define/hydrate goal when missing or inconsistent across artifacts",
        "where": "C:/Users/codya/.claude/hooks/src/hooks/goal_injector.ts; C:/Users/codya/.claude/hooks/src/hooks/goal_compliance_gate.ts; C:/Users/codya/.claude/ledger/active-goal.json",
        "why": "maintain focus and traceability across all systems uniformly; ensure no work proceeds without explicit goal alignment",
        "how": "shared formatGoalContext() injected via additionalContext in all hook event types using TypeScript 5.x, bun runtime, vitest for testing",
        "which": "C:/Users/codya/.claude/hooks/src/hooks/goal_injector.ts; C:/Users/codya/.claude/hooks/src/hooks/goal_compliance_gate.ts; C:/Users/codya/.claude/hooks/src/session/goal_stack.ts; C:/Users/codya/.claude/hooks/src/schema/task_specification.ts; C:/Users/codya/.claude/ledger/active-goal.json",
        "lest": "Goal context must not be lost on session restart; must not allow session to stop with non-compliant goal; must not proceed without explicit goal alignment; prevent drift between session goals and artifact checklists; never inject stale or orphaned goals",
        "with": "TypeScript 5.x; bun runtime; vitest; hooks framework (runner.js, types.js); session management (goal_stack.ts); CLAUDE.md display template",
        "measuredBy": "100% compliance score on goal_compliance_gate validation; all 11 Task Specification sections validated; tests passing for goal_injector, goal_compliance_gate, bun_enforcer hooks; session restart successfully hydrates goal stack from active-goal.json"
