        "who": "Claude Code sessions, GitHub issues, OpenSpec proposals, Claude Code .md plans, and their respective subtask checklists (session todos, issue body checklists, issue parent/child relationships, OpenSpec todos, plan todos)",

        "when": "every turn, every hook, every create/update/delete of any artifact; prompt user with soft suggestion to define/hydrate goal when missing or inconsistent across artifacts",
        "where": "UserPromptSubmit, PostToolUse, Stop, SessionStart hooks; session todo headers; GitHub issue bodies; OpenSpec proposal bodies; Claude Code .md plan bodies",
