      "summary": "[spinal-cord] fix(hooks): Enforce full file paths in all Claude Code operations",
      "fields": {
        "who": "Claude Code users and sessions affected by file operation ambiguity",
        "what": "All file paths in Claude Code operations MUST be absolute (full) paths",
        "when": "Current task - blocking priority for consistent file operations",
        "where": "hooks/src/hooks/full_path_validator.ts; CLAUDE.md",
        "why": "Claude Code file operations sometimes use relative paths causing ambiguity about which file is being referenced, potential for operating on wrong files when cwd changes, inconsistent path formats in logs and error messages, difficulty tracing file operations in audit logs",
        "how": "Create hook full_path_validator with PreToolUse trigger on Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep; Validate file_path starts with / (Unix) or drive letter (Windows); Block operations with relative paths; Suggest absolute path using cwd",
        "which": "Read tool file_path; Write tool file_path; Edit tool file_path; Glob pattern paths; Grep search paths",
        "lest": "Must not allow relative paths in file operations; Must not break cross-platform compatibility (Unix and Windows)",
        "with": "hooks framework; PreToolUse trigger; regex validation; path module",
        "measuredBy": "Hook implemented for all file operation tools; Cross-platform support (Unix and Windows paths); Helpful error message with suggested absolute path; CLAUDE.md updated with full path requirement"
